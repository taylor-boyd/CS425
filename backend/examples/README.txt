Each image in this folder is an average of the 200 images which achieve the highest activations for a particular feature compared with the 200 images which achieve the lowest activations. (shape) refers to the network trained on segmentation-based labels, whereas (celeba) refers to the network trained on CelebA labels.

"ear_h" is missing for unknown reasons. If I recall correctly it wasn't a very useful feature anyway. Additionally, the following three features are flipped (the highest activations are actually the lowest activations)
- eye_size
- hair_height
- bangs_height
